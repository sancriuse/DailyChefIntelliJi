# *DailyChef: A Recipe Catalogue*




_**What will the application do?**_

DailyChef allows users to record their favored recipes
and information related like time to cook, calorie intake,
ingredients, and time of the day.

_**Who will use it?**_

This application is beneficial for everyone who
cooks and is looking for a suitable way to manage
their recipes.

_**Why is this project of interest to you?**_

The motivation comes from my personal experience,
I love to cook and track the recipes I have made
and learned.
It is hard to remember the recipes one has learned
to cook, therefore a catalogue is of great help.
